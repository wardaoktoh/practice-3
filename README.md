This project applies simple linear regression to predict sales trends based on given data. The process includes:
	•	Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis
	•	Feature Engineering – Selecting relevant features for prediction
	•	Mathematical Calculations – Implementing regression formulas to establish relationships between variables
	•	Model Training & Evaluation – Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn to train and assess model accuracy
	•	Data Visualization – Creating insightful graphs with Matplotlib
